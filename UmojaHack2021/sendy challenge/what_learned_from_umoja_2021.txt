#### Top things i learned on umojaHack2021
1.make baseline and submit early as possible
2.understand the problem context and write down assumptions before you lookup
 the data sets
3.understand the variable/features meaning and effect to the target
4.use profiling for fast Analysis
5.Good coding arrangement and practice to follow ML flow
6.use varibles/feature that directly affect the target to generate possible 
new feature
7.used ID and categorical features to create new features
8.model the first model with plain-parameter algorithms
9.Try to use parameters such as iterations and overfitting detectors and 
learning rate
10.Train the model with whole training set data.
********* Don't forget to set SEED for result consistency *******
